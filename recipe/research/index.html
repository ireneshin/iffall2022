        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4-5 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup salted chicken broth (or 1 cup water with 4 teaspoons fish sauce)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine eggs, green onion, and the chicken broth in a 3 cup earthenware pot or a small, heavy bottomed stainless steel saucepan.</li>
            <li>Mix it well with a fork or whisk.</li>
            <li>Cover with dome-shaped heat-safe ceramic or stainless-steel bowl that fits over the pot.</li>
            <li>Set it over medium-low and cook for about 12 to 13 minutes (about 8 to 10 minutes if using stainless steel saucepan), until steam comes out and steamy liquid begins to drip down the sides. The eggs will smell nutty.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the lid. Drizzle the sesame oil over top and serve right away with rice.</li>
        </ol>
