        <br>
        <p>When I saw the signs, I should've let you go</p>
        <p>But I kept you beside me</p>
        <p>And if I held you back, at least I held you close</p>
        <p>Should have known you were lonely</p>
        <br>
        <p>I know things will never be the same</p>
        <p>Time we lost will never be replaced</p>
        <p>I'm the reason you forgot to love</p>
        <br>
        <p>So don't be scared to live again</p>
        <p>Be scared to live again</p>
        <p>No, don't be scared to live again</p>
        <p>Be scared to live again</p>
        <br>
        <p>You always miss the chance to fall for someone else</p>
        <p>'Cause your heart only knows me</p>
        <p>They try to win your love, but there was nothing left</p> 
        <p>They just made you feel lonely</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am not the man I used to be</p>
        <p>Did some things I couldn't let you see</p>
        <p>Refused to be the one who taints your heart</p>
        <br>
        <p>So don't be scared to live again</p>
        <p>Be scared to live again</p>
        <p>No, don't be scared to live again</p>
        <p>Be scared to live again</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>I've been praying that you find yourself</p>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>We fell apart, right from the start</p>
        <br>
        <p>I should have made you my only</p>
        <p>When it's said and done</p>
        <br>
        <p>So don't be scared to live again</p>
        <p>Be scared to live again</p>
        <p>I said don't be scared to live again</p>
        <p>Be scared to live again</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>I've been praying that you find yourself</p>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>I hope you know that</p>
        <p>We fell apart, right from the start</p>
