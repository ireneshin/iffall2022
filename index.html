            <ol>
                <li>My name is Irene! I'm a junior in Communication Design with a minor in HCI. </li>
                <li>I'm interested in UX/UI.</li>
                <li>Yes. I took Web Dev, but I'm not the most confident with JS.</li>
                <li>I hope to find coding a little more enjoyable and less stressful.</li>
                <li>Paper usually has exact measurements and is very precise. But, screens can vary in sizes depending on devices.</li>

                I'm a big fan of Apple's interactive feature when they release a new product. Images move in a sequence as the user scrolls.</li>
                <li><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> Twitter allows users to view posts that they've prioritized, while also being able to access other various pages within the site. Everything a user needs is present on the screen at all time.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> Youtube is easy to access and users can preview videos while still staying on the home page. Everything is personalized according to the user's interests.</li>
